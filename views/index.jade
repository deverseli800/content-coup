          h3.question What is this nonsense?
          p.answer This is not nonsense! We believe in the power of the internet to connect 
            | people. With so many artists and content creators representing their 
            | work online, it only seems logical that there should be a place to
            | find real work and real projects. Don't rely on your rep's rolodex 
            | alone. You have the entire world to connect with at your fingertips.

          h3.question Is this just another talent agency?
          p.answer Nope. This is an online community of talented content creators
            | ultimately representing themselves. Just as you might approach a 
            | a brand directly with an idea, now you have an online platoform 
            | where the opportunities come to you. Frankly, we are surprised this
            | didn't already exist. You can thank us later.

          h3.question What if I'm signed to a talent agency or production company?
          p.answer If you have a non-exclusive arrangement, no problem. If you 
            | have an exclusive arrange than odds are you're probably fine too, but
            | be sure to check your contract. As an example, is your production 
            | company or talent agency upset that you have a Vimeo profile? This
            | is similar, only our focus is to get you to connect with new opportunities
            | and not as much abotu only presenting your previous work all pretty-like.
            | Your production company brings in work - you know they'd be happy if 
            | you came to the table with something too. After all, why not? 
            | everybody wins.

          h3.question Will membership be free? 
          p.answer Not at first. Our ultimate goal is to build a self-sufficient 
            | community of talented creatives. We might have to charge something
            | to keep things running, but it would be a far cry from any agency
            | percentage you're used to dishing out. We want to keep more money
            | in the hands of the conent creators and more money into creating the
            | content itself. More efficient use of brand's advertising dollars 
            | and more money to the content creators just seems to make sense. 
            | We think we're on to something here.
